## Key Highlights

- ‚úÖ Layered Spring Boot architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)
- ‚úÖ Redis-powered caching with asynchronous DB persistence
- ‚úÖ Redis Pub/Sub for decoupled real-time message exchange
- ‚úÖ Modular Terraform IaC for scalable AWS infrastructure provisioning
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline with Docker image build, ECR push, and ECS Fargate deployment
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting with AWS CloudWatch integration
- ‚úÖ Environment variable injection and multi-target ALB setup

---

## Objective

This monorepo serves as a **portfolio-quality showcase** of my:

- Proficiency in **Java-based backend development**
- Experience with **Redis caching**, asynchronous data flows, and pub-sub systems
- Skill in **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform
- Ability to implement **CI/CD pipelines** for cloud-native deployments
- Focus on production-ready, modular, and maintainable architecture

---

## Usage & Navigation

Each folder is a self-contained module with:

- Setup steps inside its own `README.md`
- Independent configs, build files, and Docker/Terraform pipelines
- Ready-to-run samples for testing and exploration

> Navigate to each folder to explore the respective domain and its use-case implementation.

---
## Local Setup

Example for running Redis-based microservice:

```bash
cd Redis_with_Java-SpringBoot
./mvnw spring-boot:run


For Jenkins Pipelines:

Point Jenkins to Jenkins_Script/Jenkinsfile
Use ACTION parameter to control provision or destroy

## Final Note

This repository is crafted with the intention of helping recruiters, employers, and technical leaders assess my real-world expertise in:

-  Java Backend Engineering
-  AWS Cloud & DevOps Engineering
-  Microservices Architecture & Caching
-  CI/CD Automation and Infrastructure as Code

If you're evaluating my profile, this project demonstrates:

- My ability to build secure, scalable, and cloud-native backend systems
- A strong focus on DevOps automation, clean code, and operational excellence
- Hands-on experience with AWS services like ECS Fargate, ECR, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, and SES
- End-to-end ownership from design and development to infrastructure provisioning and production deployment

The following improvements and feature extensions are planned for future iterations:

- OAuth2 / JWT-based Authentication & Authorization : for securing REST APIs  
- Spring Cloud Gateway : setup for service routing and API gateway layer   
- Auto-scaling ECS services : using AWS Application Auto Scaling policies  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD integration : as an alternative to Jenkins pipelines  
- Helm Charts : for managing Kubernetes-based deployment in future (EKS)
