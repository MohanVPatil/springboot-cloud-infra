## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Liquibase  
- **Caching**: Redis, Pub/Sub Messaging, RedisTemplate  
- **DevOps & Automation**: Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- **Cloud**: AWS ECS (Fargate), ECR, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, SES  
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins Pipelines, Docker Build & Push, AWS Deployment  
- **Misc**: Postman, STS/IntelliJ, Linux (Ubuntu)

## 🚀 Highlights

- ✅ Clean code architecture with layered design (Controller → Service → Repository)  
- ✅ Real-time Redis cache sync with delayed DB writes (write-behind)  
- ✅ Publisher–Subscriber pattern using Redis Pub/Sub for event communication  
- ✅ Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform (modular, reusable scripts)  
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipelines from Git to AWS ECS using Jenkins  
- ✅ Logging, monitoring, and cost-optimized deployments on AWS
